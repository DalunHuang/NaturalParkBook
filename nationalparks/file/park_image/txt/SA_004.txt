The Chaco National Park (Spanish: Parque Nacional Chaco) is a national park of Argentina, located in the province of Chaco. It has an area of 150 km2. It was created in 1954 in order to protect a sample of the Eastern Chaco, composed mainly of warm lowlands, with an annual summer rainfall between 750 and 1,300 mm.This park is a protected area for the quebracho trees. Forests of quebracho colorado chaque√±o (Schinopsis balansae) were once located in the north of Santa Fe and the western half of Chaco, and had entered the northeast region of the province of Corrientes. Its strong wood and its abundant tannin caused it to be over-exploited for a century.
