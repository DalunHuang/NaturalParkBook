Alto Cariri National Park (Portuguese: Parque Nacional do Alto Cariri) is a national park in Brazil.The eastern side of the rugged Cariri massif is moist and dominated by montane rainforest. Further west it is drier and semi-deciduous forest gradually becomes dominant. In the northern portion of the Cariri massif the forests meet the deciduous forest of the Jequitinhonha depression. At the tops of the tallest and steepest hills there are stony fields with rock outcroppings, holding many species of bromeliads, orchids, cactuses and ferns. There are 35 species of amphibians, of which nine are endemic and four are new to science.
